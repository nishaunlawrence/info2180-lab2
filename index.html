                <h2>Struggling With UWI </h2>
                <p class="date">October 6, 2024 by Nishaun Lawrence</p>
                <p>At the University of the West Indies, where I am beginning my second year, my goal is to learn as much as I can. Online learning was fantastic, but since face-to-face classes began, during the past three to four weeks, juggling everything has been difficult. Every day, from getting up at 5 am to getting home around 7 pm.

                <p>My ability to exercise is now severely impacted because I am no longer able to get up or go to bed early. My GPA is also suffering as a result. The mental battle can be particularly taxing if you wake up every day feeling worn out, uninspired, and unsure of your ability to complete the tasks for the day. Every morning I must wake up at five and leave the house by six. Then, before I can go to school, I have to drop my sister off at school. Because of the traffic, it takes an hour and a half to two hours to drive to school, and it is considerably worse in the evenings while attempting to come home.</p>

    <h2>Overcoming the Struggles</h2>
    <p class="date">October 6, 2024 by Nishaun Lawrence</p>
    <p>
    In the last 24 hours, I've come to the conclusion that my problems were caused by the fact that some lecturers' methods of teaching were difficult to understand or were not properly explained. Last night, I watched a YouTube video that covered the same topic, and after watching it for about five minutes, I had it all figured out. This was a strategy I employed during my final two years of online high school. With the use of this technique, I was able to go from being an ordinary student to earning A's and winning an award for excellence. </p>

    <p>I can't credit only that behavior, but I was more focused on self-improvement. I had more time to devote to tasks that would boost my productivity. Along with increasing my performance, these practices also helped me become a more loving, understanding, and kind person. I'll definitely make an effort to practice these behaviors going forward because it appears necessary for my learning and in-depth comprehension.
